# Interpreter-Ace
the shell.py file is suposed to act like the main control for the interpreter so it is an infinite program that keeps running until exited and it calls the 
lexer from the ace file which does the further lexical analysis and parsing of the input data to do arithmetic calculations and produce outputs
The grammar file is basically what all can my interpret change into meaning full code so at this point it can only work with operators such as
multiply,divide,add,subtract,parenthesis so teh grammar shows what all thes operators fall under and how they are to processed
